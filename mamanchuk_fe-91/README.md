    - CREATE, INSERT, CONTAINS

Prefix Tree V2.1
----------------
Current update: lots of bug fixes and improved ux.

This is the third release of my original idea that is about implementation of a simple datastructure for the purpose of prefix tree.
Available concept of a command line.
Basic system operations. Some pTree operations.
Advanced logics that is being designed to work with conventional user.

Operations with pTree sets available:
	- CREATE `[RANGE] set_name_1 [set_name_2 ...]`; <br />
    - INSERT `[RANGE] set_name_1 [set_name_2 ...] "word_1" ["word_2" ...]`; <br />
    - CONTAINS `[RANGE] set_name_1 [set_name_2 ...] "word_1" ["word_2" ...]`; <br />
    - PRINT_TREE `[RANGE] set_name_1 [set_name_2 ...]`; 

System operations:
    - MENU; <br />
    - CLEAR; <br />
    - EXIT;

Quick notes:
    Commands must include ';' at some point. <br /> 
    All parameter words must be embraced with "quotes", everything else must not. <br />
    For command titles and key words letter case is ignored.
