# Prefix Tree V1.0
This is the first release of my original idea that is about implementation of a simple datastructure for the purpose of prefix tree.
Available concept of a command line.
Basic system operations. Basic pTree operations.
Logics that is being designed to work with conventional user.

Operations with pTree sets available:
	- CREATE "set_name"; 
    - INSERT "set_name" "value";
    - CONTAINS "set_name" "value";

System operations:
    - MENU;
    - CLEAR;
    - EXIT;

Quick notes:
    Commands must include ';' at some point.
    All parameters must be embraced with "quotes".
    For command titles letter case is ignored.
